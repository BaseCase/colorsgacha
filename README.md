# Colors Gacha
This is a project for Concept Development class, Fall 2021, taught by Joe Carpenter.

The idea here is to generate a set of colors randomly when a user clicks the "pull" button in the middle of the screen. They can share their results by copying the URL that's generated along with the colors.
